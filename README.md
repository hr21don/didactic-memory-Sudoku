 Your goal for this challenge is to write a Python function to solve Sudoku puzzles. 
## Challenge
Write a python function to solve a sudoku puzzle. 

## Input
Represent the Sudoku grid as a two-dimensional list of lists. 
It should have nine sub-lists, representing the rows, with nine elements each, and use the number zero to indicate empty spaces. 

You solve_sudoku function should take a new, partially filled in puzzle as input, and then return a two-dimensional list representing the solution to that puzzle with all the spaces filled in, one through nine. 

### Use the puzzle and its solution to test your solve_sudoku function!
